This example demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3 related to accessing image properties before the image has fully loaded. The `handleComplete` event listener attempts to access the `width` property of `myImage` prematurely.  The solution involves adding an event listener for the `complete` event of the `Loader` object to ensure the image is fully loaded before accessing its properties.  This prevents undefined behavior and potential errors.
